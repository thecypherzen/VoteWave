# OverView #
VoteWave is an application that allows users to create and manage polls and elections efficiently - for free - from their browser or Telegram. Polls are different from elections in that users can choose more than one option at an opinion poll but one user can only vote for one candidate in an election. 
VoteWave gives users an immersive experience that keeps them engaged while their elections/polls are ongoing through chat rooms (and possibly in-app games). It also simplifies the process of sharing and viewing results, which can be saved in various formats or posted to oneâ€™s social media with the push of a button.
